# Control-a-CNC-by-Android
My previous code (for Arduino MEGA) was made to drive a CNC with µStepper drivers and end switches.  https://github.com/wolf8012/GcodeCNC_SD_OLED_JOYSTICK  It is able to make “JOGs” , “CALIB_Z” , “HOME” , “ZERO PIECE” (in EEPROM).   And can read 4  Gcode files on a SD card line by line. (with a “Pause/Restart) It needed additional hardware : an OLED 128x64, a joystick , a few leds and buttons. (This code could also drive a Plasma cutter : see the note at the end. ) Now the additional hardware is replaced by an APK Android ( written with  MIT App Inventor ) .
